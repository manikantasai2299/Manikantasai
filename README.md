22# Hyy there...

Hi, my name is Manikanta Sai and I'm a student who is passionate about web development and artificial intelligence. I'm currently studying B.Tech at SRM, where I've been able to gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end web development, as well as the fundamentals of AI.

I've always been interested in technology and its ability to transform the world around us. As I've learned more about web development and AI, I've become increasingly excited about the potential of these fields to create innovative, data-driven solutions to complex problems.

In my free time, I love experimenting with different programming languages and frameworks, and have completed several personal projects that showcase my skills in web development and AI.
